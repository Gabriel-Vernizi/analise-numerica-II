This project implements three numerical methods for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs): Euler's method, Taylor's method, and the second-order Runge-Kutta method.

In simple terms:

- Euler's method uses the first-order Taylor expansion to estimate the next value.

- Taylor's method improves accuracy by applying the second-order Taylor expansion.

- Runge-Kutta of second order (RK2) calculates a weighted average of slopes within each step, providing a more reliable approximation than Euler's method.
